### Snake ###

A simple implementation of the class Snake game.  I wrote this for a code
challenge and used it to get my bearing in Javascript.  I'm still tinkering
with it mostly cause it's fun.  I hadn't had much oppourtunity to really dig in
to Javascript as a language until I was presented with this challenge.

I put about 20 hours in to this up to the initial commit.  Prior to that, my
experience with JavaScript was pretty limited.
